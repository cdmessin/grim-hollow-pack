    value: >-
      <p>Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must
      succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be afflicted with excruciating
      muscle spasms for the duration. A creature affected in this way has its
      speed halved and rolls attacks with disadvantage. At the end of each of
      its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a
      success, the spell ends on the target.</p>
