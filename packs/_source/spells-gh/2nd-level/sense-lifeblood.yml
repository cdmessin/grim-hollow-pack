      <p>As part of casting this spell, you must expend two hit dice or the
      spell automatically fails. If you do, you can sense the lifeblood
      flowing within creatures you can see. For the duration of the spell, you
      can sense whether and how two or more creatures you can see are related
      biologically. In addition, you know whether the creature's current hit
      points are equal to or below half their maximum hit points and, when you
      deal damage to such a creature, you roll two additional dice to deal
      bonus damage. The dice rolled to determine this bonus damage are the same
      as the two you expended to cast this spell.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell with a 4th or 5th level spell
      slot, you can maintain concentration on this spell for up to 1 hour.
      When you cast this spell with a 6th level or higher spell slot, you can
      maintain concentration on this spell for up to 8 hours.</p>
