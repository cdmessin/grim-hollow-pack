      <p>As part of casting this spell, you must expend two hit dice or the
      spell automatically fails. You draw lifeforce from those injured around
      you to create a swirling shield of blood. You gain 5 temporary hit points
      for each creature within a 30 feet radius that is below its hit point
      maximum (including you) to a maximum of 15.</p><p>While you have these
      hit points, you are considered to be behind half cover for any ranged
      attack made against you. When this spell ends, all remaining temporary
      hit points provided by it are lost.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level
      or higher, the maximum number of temporary hit points you can gain from
      casting it increases by 5 for each two slot levels above 2nd.</p>
