    value: >-
      <p>You consume the brain of another creature's corpse, gaining its
      memories and knowledge. The corpse must have a brain and can't be undead.
      The spell fails if the corpse has been dead (and not preserved) for more
      than three days.</p><p>Until the spell ends, you can attempt to recall
      any important fact known to the creature—family history, recent events,
      building layouts, passwords, details of the creature's death, and
      similar information. To recall a piece of information, you must make an
      ability check using your spellcasting modifier. The DC is equal to the
      corpse's Intelligence score.</p><p>Once the caster rolls to determine
      whether they recall a fact, they cannot attempt to recall it again.</p>
