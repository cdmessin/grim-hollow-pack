      <p>As part of casting this spell, you must expend four hit dice or the
      spell automatically fails. If you do, choose a point on the ground
      within range and roll the expended hit dice. A crimson pillar erupts from
      the ground in a 15-foot radius and 100-foot high cylinder centered on
      the point you chose. Each creature within the cylinder must make a
      Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature takes necrotic
      damage equal to the total of the expended hit dice. On a failure, the
      creature takes necrotic damage equal to the total of the expended hit
      dice and must expend and roll four hit dice of its own, taking additional
      necrotic damage equal to the result.</p><p>For each creature who fails
      the saving throw against this spell, you gain 5 temporary hit
      points.</p>
