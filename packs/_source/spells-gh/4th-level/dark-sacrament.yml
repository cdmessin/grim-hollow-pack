      <p>As part of casting this spell you must expend four hit dice or the
      spell automatically fails. If you do, make a melee spell attack against a
      creature within 5 feet using the material component of this spell. On a
      hit, roll the hit dice expended casting this spell plus an additional 4d8
      and deal necrotic damage equal to the result. If this damage causes the
      creature to be reduced to 0 hit points, it immediately dies and you gain
      one of the following dark blessings of your choice.</p><p><strong>
      Unassailable.</strong> You have advantage on all saving
      throws.</p><p><strong>Unbreakable.</strong> Your size increases by one
      category (from Medium to Large, for example), you gain a number of
      temporary hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) at
      the start of each of your turns, and your weapon attacks deal an
      additional 1d4 damage.</p><p><strong>Unerring.</strong> Your proficiency
      bonus increases by 2.</p><p>Your dark blessing ends after 10 minutes or
      when you are reduced to 0 hit points, whichever happens first. When you
      take radiant damage while you have a dark blessing, you take an
      additional 1d4 damage.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you
      cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the melee
      spell attack damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.</p>
