      <p>Until the spell ends, your veins bulge and become visibly green
      beneath your skin, your eyes weep constantly with liquid poison, and you
      gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li>You are immune to poison damage
      and the poisoned condition.</li><li>When you choose a creature you can
      see within 30 feet, you know if it has poison resistance or immunity, as
      well as if it is immune to the poisoned condition.</li><li>You can use a
      bonus action on your turn and choose a creature within 30 feet. That
      creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the
      creature loses any resistance or immunity it has to poison damage or the
      poisoned condition until the end of your next turn.</li><li>You can use
      your action to launch a geyser of toxins in a line 15 feet long and 5
      feet wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in
      the line must make a Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 poison damage
      on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature
      that fails its save against this effect is also poisoned until the end
      of your next turn.</li></ul>
