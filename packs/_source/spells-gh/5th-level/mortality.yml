      <p>As part of casting this spell you must expend five hit dice or the
      spell automatically fails. When you do, choose an aberration, celestial,
      elemental, fey, or fiend within range and condemn it to a taste of
      mortality. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or have
      its current and maximum hit points reduced. Roll the hit dice expended to
      cast this spell to determine the amount the creature's current and
      maximum hit points are reduced by.</p><p>Additionally, for the duration
      of the spell, a creature that fails the saving throw loses all damage
      immunities and resistances, its creature type changes to humanoid, and
      takes an additional 1d4 necrotic damage each time it takes
      damage.</p><p>If a creature affected by this spell is reduced to 0 hit
      points, these changes become permanent and the creature dies. This final
      effect of the spell can only be reversed if the creature is restored to
      life and targeted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.</p>
