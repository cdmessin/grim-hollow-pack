      <p>When you cast this spell, you drop to 0 hit points and die. At the
      start of your next turn, you become a ghost occupying the same space as
      your corpse. You use the ghost's game statistics, retaining your
      alignment and personality.</p><p>While you are a ghost, you can only use
      abilities detailed in the ghost's game statistics. In addition, you add
      your proficiency bonus to your attack rolls and the DC of saving throws
      your ghost abilities force others to make.</p><p>Your DM secretly rolls
      1d8 at the time of casting. After a number of hours have passed equal to
      the result, the spell ends. The spell ends early if you are reduced to 0
      hit points as a ghost or you use an action to do so. If the material
      component used to cast this spell remains on your corpse, you return to
      life with current hit points equal to half your maximum hit points. If
      the material component used to cast this spell is no longer on your
      corpse, you must make death saving throws as normal.</p><p>If your body
      is destroyed or damaged beyond the capacity to survive while you are
      under the effects of this spell, its duration becomes indefinite and you
      remain a ghost until you are reduced to 0 hit points, destroyed by any
      other effect, or your body is targeted by an effect that returns the
      living to the dead such as raise dead or resurrection.</p>
