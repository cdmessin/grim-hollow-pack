      <p>When you cast this spell, you wave the red handkerchief used as the
      material component and choose any number of creatures within range that
      can see you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
      charmed by you until the spell ends or until you or your allies do
      anything harmful to it. While charmed in this way, it must use its turn
      to make unarmed strikes against the nearest creature (other than you) or
      use its turn moving to the nearest target.</p><p>At the end of each of
      its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it
      succeeds, this effect ends for that target.</p>
