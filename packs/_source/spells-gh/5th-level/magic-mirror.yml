      <p>A momentary bubble of iridescent energy shimmers in the air between
      you and the caster of the triggering spell. The spell is redirected to a
      creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet. If the spell is
      5th level or lower, you are no longer a target of the spell and the
      chosen creature is instead. If the spell is 6th level or higher, make an
      ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the
      spell's level. On a successful check, you are no longer a target of the
      spell and the chosen creature is instead. On a failed check, you remain
      the target of the triggering spell.</p>
