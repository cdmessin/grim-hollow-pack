      <p>You transform your tongue into a poisonous serpent for the duration.
      When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a
      creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 piercing
      damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become
      poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of
      each turn, ending the condition on a success.</p><p>As a bonus action on
      your turn, you can repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of
      you.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8
      for every level above 3rd.</p>
