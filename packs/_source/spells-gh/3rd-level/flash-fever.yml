    value: >-
      <p>A living creature you choose within range breaks out into a cold sweat
      and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the cold sweat
      breaks into fever as the creature's skin becomes flushed and hot to the
      touch, and the creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of its next
      turn. On a success, the spell immediately ends.</p><p>While the spell
      persists, you can use a reaction at the start of an affected creature's
      turn to force the creature to take fire damage again, increasing by 1d6
      each time. The creature can use its action to attempt to cool itself,
      allowing it to attempt the Constitution saving throw again. On a success,
      the creature's fever breaks and the spell ends.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level
      or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
      3rd.</p>
