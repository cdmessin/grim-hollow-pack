      <p>As part of casting this spell, you must expend three hit dice or the
      spell automatically fails. When you do, you smear the material component
      used to cast this spell with your blood. The object shudders and becomes
      a sanguine poppet under your control.</p><p>Your sanguine poppet has an
      AC equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus + your spellcasting ability
      modifier and 30 hp. If your sanguine poppet is ever reduced to 0 hp or
      is more than a mile away, the spell ends immediately. As a bonus action
      on your turn, your sanguine poppet can walk or climb up to 30 feet, and
      you can see and hear through them until the start of your next
      turn.</p><p>As an action, you can cause the poppet to self-destruct in an
      explosion of blood, ending this spell. Roll the hit dice expended casting
      this spell, and each creature within 30 feet of the poppet must succeed
      on a Constitution saving throw or take necrotic damage equal to the
      result. Creatures who succeed on the saving throw take half as much
      damage.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can expend an additional
      hit die for each spell slot level above 3rd. Additionally, the duration
      of this spell increases by one hour for each spell slot level above
      3rd.</p>
