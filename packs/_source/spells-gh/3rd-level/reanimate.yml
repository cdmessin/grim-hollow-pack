      <p>As part of casting this spell you must expend three hit dice or the
      spell automatically fails. If you do, you can touch a creature who has
      died within the last 10 minutes and return it to life with 1 hit point.
      In addition, roll the hit dice you expended casting this spell, and the
      creature gains temporary hit points equal to the result.</p><p>At the
      start of each of the target creature's turns, it loses 1 temporary hit
      point granted by this spell. While the creature has any temporary hit
      points granted by this spell it moves with unnatural vigor, gaining a +2
      bonus to all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. Once it
      loses all remaining temporary hit points granted by this spell, the
      creature gains a level of exhaustion.</p><p>This spell can't return to
      life a creature who has died of old age, nor can it restore missing body
      parts.</p>
