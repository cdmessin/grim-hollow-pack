    value: >-
      <p>You create a pair of grasping hands made from invisible forces. Make a
      spell attack against one creature that you can see within range. On a
      hit, the creature is restrained as the hands crush their throat or bodily
      equivalent.</p><p>If the creature requires air to breathe, it begins to
      suffocate. A suffocating creature can survive for a number of rounds
      equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the
      start of its next turn after those rounds are over, it becomes
      unconscious, and it can't regain hit points until it can breathe
      again.</p><p>A conscious creature restrained by the hands can use its
      action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your
      spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends on the target.</p>
