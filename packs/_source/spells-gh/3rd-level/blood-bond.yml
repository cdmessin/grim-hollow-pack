      <p>As part of casting this spell, you must expend three hit dice or the
      spell automatically fails. If you do, roll the expended hit dice, and the
      creature gains an equal number of temporary hit points.</p><p>For the
      duration of the spell, you know the direction and distance to the
      creature at all times, you and the creature can speak to one another
      telepathically (provided the creature has an intelligence score of 3 or
      higher), and you can target the creature with spells you cast that have a
      range of Self or Touch. These benefits are suppressed while you and the
      creature are not on the same plane.</p><p>At any point, a creature
      affected by this spell can choose to end the spell early. If it does, the
      creature loses all remaining temporary hit points granted by this spell
      and takes necrotic damage equal to the temporary hit points
      lost.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 5th or 6th level, its duration is 8 hours. When
      you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, its duration
      is 24 hours. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level,
      its duration is 7 days.</p>
