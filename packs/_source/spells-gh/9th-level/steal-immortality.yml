      <p>As part of casting this spell, you must expend nine hit dice or the
      spell automatically fails. If you do, roll the expended hit dice and note
      the total as your "mortal hit points," then the creature who triggered
      this spell by being reduced to 0 hp immediately dies. If it would
      normally return to its native plane at 0 hp, it is destroyed instead.
      Change your creature type to that of the dead creature.</p><p>Whilst
      changed, you are immune to poison and disease; no longer need to eat,
      drink, or breathe; resistant to nonmagical damage; and gain a benefit
      dependent on your new creature type:</p><p><strong>Celestial.</strong> You
      have resistance to radiant and necrotic damage and gain a fly speed of 60
      feet.</p><p><strong>Elemental.</strong> You have resistance to acid, cold,
      fire, lightning, and thunder damage.</p><p><strong>Fey.</strong> You can
      use a bonus action on each of your turns to turn invisible until the
      start of your next turn or teleport up to 60 feet in any
      direction.</p><p><strong>Fiend.</strong> You have resistance to cold and
      fire damage and gain a fly speed of 60
      feet.</p><p><strong>Undead.</strong> You are immune to necrotic damage and
      being charmed or frightened.</p><p>Your creature type is retained until
      you cast the spell again, immediately ending its effects, or you take
      damage that reduces you to 0 hp, wherein your creature type returns to
      normal and your hp to the number noted as your mortal hit points.</p>
