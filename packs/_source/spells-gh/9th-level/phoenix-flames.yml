    value: >-
      <p>You immolate yourself, consuming your body in a searing cloud of holy
      flames. All creatures within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution
      saving throw or take 30d6 radiant damage and gain one level of
      exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not
      exhausted. If a target is killed by this damage, its body is
      incinerated.</p><p>After 10 minutes, you rise from the ashes where you
      originally cast the spell. You are returned fully to life as if you were
      affected by a <em>true resurrection</em> spell.</p>
