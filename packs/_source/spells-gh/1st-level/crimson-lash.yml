      <p>As part of casting this spell, you must expend a hit die or the spell
      automatically fails. If you do, a writhing lash of coagulated blood
      springs from your hand.</p><p>This magic weapon lasts until the spell
      ends. It counts as a simple weapon with which you are proficient, and it
      has the light, finesse, and reach properties. You can choose to add your
      spellcasting modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, to
      attack and damage rolls with this weapon. Its damage die is equivalent to
      the hit die expended casting this spell, and the damage dealt is
      necrotic. Each time a creature takes damage from this magic weapon, its
      maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage it
      took.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, when you take the Attack action,
      you can make two weapon attacks, provided both are with this magic
      weapon. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, when you take
      the Attack action you make three weapon attacks, provided all are with
      this magic weapon.</p>
