      <p>You detach your hand at the wrist, transforming it into a spider.
      While the spider is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it
      telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through its eyes
      and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn. During this
      time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own
      senses.</p><p>If the spider is killed or prevented from returning to you,
      your hand is restored, but you take 1d6 points of psychic damage. If you
      command the spider to return, it crawls back to your wrist, and the spell
      ends.</p>
