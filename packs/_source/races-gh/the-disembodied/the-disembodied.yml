      <p>The Disembodied are spirits who have lost their physical forms but
      persist through sheer force of will or arcane accident. They exist as
      translucent, ghostly figures, trapped between the material world and
      the planes beyond. Though they lack true bodies, they can interact
      with the physical world through concentrated effort and magical
      energy.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Intelligence
      score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Age.</strong></em> The Disembodied do not age in the
      traditional sense. They persist as spirits for as long as their will
      endures, though most fade after several centuries.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> The Disembodied appear as they did
      in life, though slightly translucent. Your size is Medium.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30
      feet.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Fade Away.</strong></em> As a reaction when you take
      damage, you can become incorporeal until the start of your next turn.
      While incorporeal, you have resistance to all damage except force and
      psychic damage, and you can move through creatures and objects as if
      they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you
      take 1d10 force damage and are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space.
      Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short
      or long rest.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Planar Outcast.</strong></em> You have resistance to
      necrotic damage. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws
      against effects that would banish you to another plane of
      existence.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Arcane Origins.</strong></em> You know the
      <em>mage hand</em> cantrip. When you cast it, the hand is invisible.
      Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p>

      <p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write
      Common and one other language of your choice.</p>
