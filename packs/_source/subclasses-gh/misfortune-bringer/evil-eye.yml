    value: >-
      <p>As a bonus action, you can curse a creature you can see within 30 feet
      of you. Choose one: the creature has disadvantage on its next ability
      check, attack roll, or saving throw (your choice). The curse lasts until
      the end of your next turn or until triggered.</p>
      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
      modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.</p>
