    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet succeeds on a
      saving throw or hits with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to
      steal its luck, forcing it to reroll and use the lower result.</p>
      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
      modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.</p>
