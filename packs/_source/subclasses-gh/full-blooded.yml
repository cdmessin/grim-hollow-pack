      <p>Starting at 2nd level, when you expend hit dice as part of casting a
      spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the number of hit points
      you regain from each hit die spent (minimum of 1). Additionally, when you
      cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals necrotic damage or restores
      hit points, you can expend one hit die, rolling it and regaining hit
      points equal to the result plus your Intelligence modifier.</p>
