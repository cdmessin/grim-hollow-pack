    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to transform into creatures of the
      night. You can cast polymorph on yourself (no concentration required) to
      transform into a bat, rat, or wolf. While transformed, you retain your
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you can move along vertical surfaces and upside down on
      ceilings without needing to make an ability check, as per the spider
      climb spell.</p>
