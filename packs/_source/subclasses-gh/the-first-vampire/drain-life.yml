      <p>At 1st level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can drain
      its life force to heal yourself. You regain hit points equal to half the
      damage dealt. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
      proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a
      long rest.</p>
