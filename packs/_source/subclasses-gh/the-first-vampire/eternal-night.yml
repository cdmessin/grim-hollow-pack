      <p>At 14th level, you can use an action to create a 30-foot radius sphere
      of magical darkness centered on yourself that lasts for 1 minute. The
      darkness moves with you and cannot be dispelled by nonmagical light or
      spells of 3rd level or lower.</p>
      <p>While within the darkness, you have advantage on all attack rolls, and
      hostile creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
      Additionally, you are immune to radiant damage while within this area.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
