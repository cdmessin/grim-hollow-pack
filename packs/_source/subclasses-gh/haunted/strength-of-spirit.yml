      <p>At 6th level, you can use your reaction to become incorporeal until the start of your next turn by spending 2 sorcery points. While incorporeal, you have resistance to all damage except force and psychic damage, and you can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you take 1d10 force damage.</p>
