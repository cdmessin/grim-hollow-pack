      <p>At 14th level, as an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to command your phantom to possess a creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC or be controlled by you as if by the dominate monster spell. The effect lasts for 1 minute and requires your concentration.</p>
