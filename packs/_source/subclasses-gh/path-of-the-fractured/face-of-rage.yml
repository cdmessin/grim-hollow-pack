    value: >-
      <p>When you rage, your face transforms into a terrifying visage. Each
      creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that can see you must
      succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus
      + your Constitution modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of
      your next turn. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune
      to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
