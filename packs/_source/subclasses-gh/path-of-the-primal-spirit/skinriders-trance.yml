    value: >-
      <p>You can enter a trance as an action, allowing you to see through your
      primal companion's eyes and hear through its ears for up to 1 hour.
      During this time, you are blind and deaf with regard to your own
      senses.</p>
      <p>While in the trance, you can control your companion's actions directly
      as if you were in its space. You can end the trance at any time (no
      action required).</p>
