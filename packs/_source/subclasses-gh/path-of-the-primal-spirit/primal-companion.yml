    value: >-
      <p>You gain a primal spirit companion that takes the form of a beast.
      Choose one of the following forms: Bear, Eagle, or Wolf. The spirit
      manifests physically and fights alongside you. It uses your proficiency
      bonus for its AC, attack rolls, saving throws, and damage.</p>
      <p>The spirit obeys your commands and takes its turn immediately after
      yours. If you don't issue a command, it takes the Dodge action. If the
      spirit is reduced to 0 hit points, it vanishes and can be resummoned
      after a long rest.</p>
