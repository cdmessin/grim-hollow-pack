    value: >-
      <p>You can use a bonus action to merge with your primal companion,
      physically transforming into a powerful hybrid form for 1 minute. In this
      form, you gain the benefits of your companion's Kin to Beasts feature,
      your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type,
      and you gain 30 temporary hit points.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
