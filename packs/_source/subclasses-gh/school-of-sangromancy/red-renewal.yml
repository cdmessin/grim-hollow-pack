      <p>Beginning at 14th level, when you finish a short rest, you regain a
      number of expended hit dice equal to half your wizard level (rounded
      down), in addition to any hit dice you would normally regain.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, when you cast a wizard spell of 5th level or lower that
      has a casting time of one action, you can expend two hit dice to cast it
      as a bonus action instead.</p>
