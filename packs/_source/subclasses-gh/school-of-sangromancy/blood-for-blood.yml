      <p>Starting at 10th level, when a creature within 60 feet of you that you
      can see takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend a hit die.
      Roll the hit die and add your Intelligence modifier; the creature takes
      additional necrotic damage equal to the total. You regain hit points equal
      to half the necrotic damage dealt (rounded down).</p>
      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence
      modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you
      finish a long rest.</p>
