    value: >-
      <p>At 14th level, you can use an action and expend a 5th-level or higher
      spell slot to summon a blood elemental in an unoccupied space within 30 feet
      of you. The blood elemental is friendly to you and your companions, obeys
      your verbal commands, and acts on your initiative count. It remains for 1
      hour, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you dismiss it (no action
      required).</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
