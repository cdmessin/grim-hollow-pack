    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, as an action, you can infect a creature within 5 feet with a parasitic spawn. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for up to 1 hour. While charmed, the creature regards you as a trusted ally and follows your verbal commands. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
