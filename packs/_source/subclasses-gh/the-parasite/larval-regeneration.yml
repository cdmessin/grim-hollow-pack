      <p>At 14th level, the parasite's regenerative abilities merge with your own. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points remaining and at least 1 hit point.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, the parasite can revive you. You drop to 1 hit point instead and gain temporary hit points equal to your warlock level. Once the parasite revives you in this way, it can't do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
