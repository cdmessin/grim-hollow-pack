    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, when you enter your Wild Shape, you gain a number of mutation
      points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). Unspent mutation points
      are lost when you leave your beast shape.</p>
      <p>In addition, you can use an action to touch a beast and expend a spell slot,
      causing it to mutate. You gain a number of mutation points equal to the level
      of the spell slot or the CR of the beast, whichever is lower. As part of the
      same action, you must spend all mutation points on mutations which manifest in
      the beast. Unspent points are lost. Mutations remain indefinitely until the
      same beast is targeted by a different use of this feature or by dispel magic,
      remove curse, or similar magic.</p>
