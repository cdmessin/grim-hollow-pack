      <p>Beginning at 18th level, your magic has become powerful enough that
      you can call and command a servant aligned with the being that cursed
      your ancestor. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to summon a
      creature related to your Blood Ties choice (a fey creature, fiend, or
      undead of CR 6 or lower). The creature appears in an unoccupied space
      within 30 feet, is friendly to you and your allies, and obeys your
      commands. It remains for 1 hour, until reduced to 0 hit points, or until
      you dismiss it (no action required).</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
