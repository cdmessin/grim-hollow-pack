      <p>At 1st level, your senses easily attune to the supernatural forces
      that caused your inherited affliction. You know the detect evil and good
      spell and can cast it without expending a spell slot. This spell counts
      as a sorcerer spell for you but does not count against your number of
      spells known. Once you cast this spell without using a spell slot, you
      can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
      <p>In addition, choose one of the following creature types as the being
      which cursed your ancestor: fey, fiend, or undead. While you are
      concentrating on the detect evil and good spell, creatures of your chosen
      type have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and you cannot be
      charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.</p>
