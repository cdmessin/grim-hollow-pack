    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, you have mastered the ability to temporarily
      cast a small fragment of your curse onto another. As a bonus action,
      choose a creature you can see within 30 feet. The chosen creature has
      disadvantage on the next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it
      makes.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a
      short or long rest, unless you spend 1 sorcery point to use it again.</p>
