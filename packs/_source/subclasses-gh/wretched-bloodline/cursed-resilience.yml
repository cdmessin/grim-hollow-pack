      <p>At 14th level, the curse within your blood has become a source of
      strength. You gain resistance to necrotic damage.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when a creature attempts to charm, frighten, or possess
      you, you can use your reaction to spend 3 sorcery points and reflect the
      effect back on the creature. The creature must succeed on a saving throw
      against your sorcerer spell save DC or be subjected to the same
      effect.</p>
