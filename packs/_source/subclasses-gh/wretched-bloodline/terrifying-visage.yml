      <p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use a bonus action to adopt the
      terrifying visage of the being who cursed your ancestor for 10 minutes.
      During this time, you can use an action on each of your turns to force
      each creature within 30 feet that can see you to make a Wisdom saving
      throw against your sorcerer spell save DC. On a failure, a creature is
      frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
      <p>While you have adopted the terrifying visage, you gain an additional
      benefit based on the creature type chosen with your Blood Ties
      feature:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fey:</strong> You can use a bonus action to teleport up to
        30 feet in any direction.</li>
        <li><strong>Fiend:</strong> You gain resistance to cold and fire
        damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Undead:</strong> When you take damage that isn't radiant,
        you can use your reaction to reduce that damage by an amount equal to
        half your sorcerer level.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
