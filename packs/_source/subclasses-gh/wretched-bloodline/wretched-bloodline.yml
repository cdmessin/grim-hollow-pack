    value: >-
      <p>With every promise made to a fairy, contract signed with a devil, and
      pact with the unquiet dead, there's a chance someone doesn't bear the
      full brunt of the bargain. The vengeance of immortal beings lasts much
      longer than one lifetime, and the lingering magic of these curses can
      affect the mortal's descendants. A child born of such a family may learn
      to master the latent magic within their inherited curse, turning their
      bloodline's bane into a personal boon.</p>
