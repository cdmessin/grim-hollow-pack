      <p>At 15th level, as an action, you can force a creature within 30 feet
      that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your paladin
      spell save DC. On a failure, the creature must answer one question you
      ask truthfully, or take 4d8 psychic damage. The creature can choose to
      take the damage instead of answering. Once you use this feature, you
      can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
