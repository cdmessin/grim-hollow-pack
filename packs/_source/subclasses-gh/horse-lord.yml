    value: >-
      <p>At 9th level, while mounted on your bonded mount, you have advantage
      on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller
      than your mount.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it
      to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead
      takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage
      if it fails.</p>
      <p>Your mount's speed also increases by 10 feet.</p>
