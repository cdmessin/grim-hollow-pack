      <p>At 14th level, your potions created by Potion Craft are twice as
      effective (double the healing and damage dice).</p>
      <p>Additionally, you can cast <em>heal</em> once without expending a spell
      slot. Once you do so, you can't do so again until you finish a long
      rest.</p>
