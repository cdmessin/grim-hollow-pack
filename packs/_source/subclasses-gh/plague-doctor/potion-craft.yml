      <p>At 2nd level, you gain proficiency with the herbalism kit and
      poisoner's kit if you don't already have them.</p>
      <p>During a long rest, you can use your herbalism kit or poisoner's kit
      to create a number of potions equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum
      of 1). Choose from the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Healing Draught:</strong> A creature that drinks this potion
      regains hit points equal to 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier.</li>
      <li><strong>Antidote:</strong> A creature that drinks this potion ends the
      poisoned condition and gains immunity to poison for 1 hour.</li>
      <li><strong>Poison Vial:</strong> As an action, throw at a creature within
      20 feet. The creature takes 2d6 poison damage (Constitution save for half)
      against your wizard spell save DC.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Potions created in this way lose potency after 24 hours.</p>
