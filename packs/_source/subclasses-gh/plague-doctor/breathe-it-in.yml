    value: >-
      <p>At 10th level, when you cast a wizard spell that deals poison or
      necrotic damage and targets only one creature, you can change the spell to
      instead affect all creatures in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the
      original target. Each creature in the area must make the spell's saving
      throw.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
