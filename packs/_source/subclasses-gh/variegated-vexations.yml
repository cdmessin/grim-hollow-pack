      <p>At 11th level, your poisons become supernaturally potent. When you use
      your Envenomed Attack feature, you can choose to change the damage type
      from poison to acid or necrotic.</p>
      <p>Additionally, creatures poisoned by your Envenomed Attack have
      disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on
      spells.</p>
