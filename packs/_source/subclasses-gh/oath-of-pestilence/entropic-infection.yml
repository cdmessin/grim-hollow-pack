      <p>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to infect a creature
      with entropic energy. Touch a creature; it must succeed on a Constitution
      saving throw or take 2d8 necrotic damage and be unable to regain hit
      points for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
      of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>
