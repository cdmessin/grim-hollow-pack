      <p>As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity to afflict a creature.
      Choose a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. It must succeed on a
      Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved and disadvantage on
      Dexterity checks and saving throws for 1 minute. The creature can repeat
      the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a
      success.</p>
