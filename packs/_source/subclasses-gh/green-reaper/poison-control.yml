    value: >-
      <p>Beginning at 7th level, when you deal poison damage to a creature that
      is resistant to poison damage, you can ignore that resistance. If a
      creature is immune to poison damage, it is treated as having resistance
      instead (which you then ignore).</p>
      <p>Additionally, when a creature fails its saving throw against your
      Envenomed Attack, you can choose one of the following additional
      effects:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Its speed is halved until the end of your next turn.</li>
      <li>It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>
      <li>It has disadvantage on the next ability check it makes before the end
      of your next turn.</li>
      </ul>
