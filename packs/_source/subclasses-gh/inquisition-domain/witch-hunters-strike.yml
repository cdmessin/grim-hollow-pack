    value: >-
      <p>Starting at 1st level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack,
      you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in
      addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level
      spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st.</p>
      <p>If the target is a fiend, undead, or a creature with the Spellcasting
      feature, the extra damage increases by 1d8.</p>
