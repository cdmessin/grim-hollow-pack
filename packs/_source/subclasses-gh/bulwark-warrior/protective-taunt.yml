      <p>As a bonus action, you can taunt a creature within 30 feet of you that
      can see or hear you. Until the start of your next turn, the creature has
      disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you.</p>
      <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution
