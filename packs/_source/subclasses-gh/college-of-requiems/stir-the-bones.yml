    value: >-
      <p>At 6th level, you learn the animate dead spell, which counts as a bard spell for you and doesn't count against your number of bard spells known.</p>
      <p>When you give a creature one of your Bardic Inspiration dice, you can choose a number of undead creatures equal to your proficiency bonus under your control within 60 feet. Each chosen undead gains a Dirge die, which functions the same as a Bardic Inspiration die. A Dirge die is lost if not spent within 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>You can issue mental commands to undead creatures under your control as part of the same bonus action you use to grant Bardic Inspiration. When an undead creature you control expends a Dirge die on an attack roll that hits, it can also add the result to the damage roll.</p>
