      <p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to pluck at the tethers of life within a creature using your Bardic Inspiration.</p>
      <p>A creature with one of your Bardic Inspiration dice can expend it when dealing damage with a weapon attack to deal additional necrotic damage equal to the die result.</p>
