    value: >-
      <p>At 3rd level, you gain a loyal mount. You can spend 8 hours bonding
      with a horse or similar beast. While bonded, the mount gains hit points
      equal to your rogue level x 3, and it adds your proficiency bonus to
      its AC and saving throws. If your mount dies, you can bond with a new
      one after a long rest.</p>
      <p>While mounted on your bonded mount, you can use your Cunning Action
      to command the mount to take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action.</p>
