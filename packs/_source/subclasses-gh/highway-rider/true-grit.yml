      <p>Beginning at 13th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not
      killed outright, you can make a single weapon attack as a reaction before
      falling unconscious. If this attack hits, you regain hit points equal to
      twice your rogue level.</p>
      <p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
      long rest.</p>
