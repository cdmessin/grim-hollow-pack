      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with
      martial ranged weapons. Additionally, you can draw or stow up to two
      weapons as part of each of your turns (instead of one), and being within
      5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged
      attack rolls.</p>
