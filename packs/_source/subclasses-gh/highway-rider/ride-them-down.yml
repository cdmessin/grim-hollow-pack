      <p>Starting at 3rd level, if your mount moves at least 20 feet straight
      toward a creature before you make a melee weapon attack against it on
      the same turn, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage. This extra damage
      can be combined with your Sneak Attack.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw
      (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or
      be knocked prone.</p>
